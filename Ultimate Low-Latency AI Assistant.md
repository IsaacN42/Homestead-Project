# Ultimate Low-Latency AI Assistant Optimization Plan

---

## 1. Wake Word Detection

- Use ultra-low-latency, on-device wake word engines optimized for embedded hardware.  
  - **Porcupine (Picovoice)** offers sub-100ms wake detection with low CPU usage.  
  - Consider FPGA or MCU accelerators for wake word detection if hardware hacking Alexa Gen 2.  
- **Optimization:**  
  - Optimize acoustic model size for smallest footprint without accuracy loss.  
  - Run wake detection with realtime priority on dedicated CPU core or embedded co-processor.

---

## 2. Audio Streaming

- Use zero-copy audio buffers between Alexa and Fathom (e.g., shared memory or RDMA over LAN).  
- Use low-latency protocols like RTP/UDP with jitter buffers tuned for minimum buffering.  
- Use lossless compressed audio codecs with minimal latency (e.g., Opus codec tuned for low delay).

---

## 3. Speech-to-Text (ASR)

- Use smaller, optimized ASR models tuned to your domain/vocabulary to reduce compute.  
- Explore quantized Whisper models (INT8 or INT4) with minimal accuracy loss but major speedups.  
- Use NVIDIA TensorRT or ONNX Runtime with GPU acceleration and kernel fusion on RTX 3060.  
- Consider streaming ASR architectures like Whisper streaming variant or NVIDIA Jarvis/NeMo ASR.  
- **Algorithmic tricks:**  
  - Early-exit mechanisms for partial results faster.  
  - Beam search pruning to trade slight accuracy for speed.  
  - Audio chunking with overlap-add to keep steady stream and reduce latency.

## 4. Intent Parsing & Natural Language Understanding

- Replace heavy ML NLU with rule-based parsers or lightweight fine-tuned transformers.  
- Use distilled or quantized transformers (TinyBERT, DistilBERT) optimized with ONNX Runtime.  
- Cache common intents for instant recognition.  
- Use faster libraries like spaCy with pre-compiled pipelines instead of generic Python NLP stacks.

---

## 5. LLM Response Generation

- Run optimized quantized LLMs locally (4-bit quantized GPT4All-J, GPTQ, LLaMA variants) with GPU acceleration.  
- Use batching and caching of common responses.  
- Employ context window pruning dynamically to reduce input size.  
- Use frameworks optimized for speed: FasterTransformer, GGML, Exllama, llama.cpp with CUDA.  
- Hybrid approach: fallback to template-based responses for low complexity.

---

## 6. Text-to-Speech (TTS)

- Use streaming TTS models that start outputting audio before full synthesis completes (NVIDIA Riva, Coqui TTS).  
- Use smaller or quantized TTS models efficiently running on GPU.  
- Optimize buffer sizes to reduce latency from text to sound output.

---

## 7. System & Software Engineering

- Run AI inference with real-time OS priorities on dedicated CPU cores or GPU queues.  
- Use asynchronous I/O and zero-copy buffers internally to minimize IPC delays.  
- Pre-load AI models into GPU memory at startup to avoid load delays.  
- Optimize Docker containers for minimal overhead (Alpine base, slim Python installs).  
- Tune NVMe PM981a SSD queue depth for max throughput and min latency.

---

## 8. Network & Data Flow

- Use LAN multicast or peer-to-peer streaming protocols to minimize audio packet hops.  
- Use custom audio-over-IPC or shared-memory channels for near-instant audio handoff if co-located.  
- Consider USB audio forwarding hacks for near-zero latency mic/speaker forwarding (hardware hack Alexa).
